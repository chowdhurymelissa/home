<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Before you begin, you should be aware that Valorant has 13 rounds and one life per player every round. You utilize your powers and weapons to go against opponents, and as an attacker, you try to plant the spike, while as a defender, you strive to prevent the other team from planting the spike</p>

<h2>Sides</h2>
<p>You begin the game on either the offensive or defensive side, which is switched mid-game. Remember that in order to begin the round, you must first purchase a weapon from the shop. What you buy determines whether or not you win a round.</p>

<h2>Map</h2>
<p>Collaborate with your team to attack the map and find your best bet for either planting or defusing the spike. Keep an eye on your angles, coordinate collectively, and adapt together during the game.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
